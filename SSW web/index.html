                                <p>My name is Eryk, and I'm 23 years old.
                                    I'm a beginner frontend developer who aims to spread my wings and become one of the best in this industry.
                                    My passion for programming started with three questions:
                                    How does it work? Why does it work? How can I do it?
                                    Since then, four months have passed, and I continue to explore the wonders of programming with curiosity and passion,
                                        just like a child discovering their own magnificent world!</p>
